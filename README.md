# Telecom Outage Regression

This project builds a multiple linear regression model to predict the number of seconds a telecom customer experiences service outages per week (`Outage_sec_perweek`). The goal is to help telecom providers identify patterns that contribute to poor service quality and proactively address high-risk customers.

A full data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline was implemented to prepare the dataset for modeling. Both the raw and cleaned versions of the dataset are included for reproducibility.

## Project Overview

- Objective: Predict weekly outage duration (`Outage_sec_perweek`) based on customer features
- Model: Multiple Linear Regression (OLS via `statsmodels`)
- Dataset: Includes telecom usage and service metrics

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis 
- Feature selection and multicollinearity checks
- Residual diagnostics and model fit evaluation
- Regression interpretation and business framing
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`
